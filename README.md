# Triage2Elastic

**Triage2Elastic** is a Docker-based tool that automates the processing of triage collections from Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. It uses Plaso (`log2timeline.py`) to generate supertimelines from forensic artifacts and exports them directly to Elasticsearch using `psort.py`.

For collecting triage data, it is recommended to use KAPE (Windows only) or CyLR (which also supports Linux and macOS). 
Both tools support SFTP output.
