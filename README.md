# Triage2Elastic

**Triage2Elastic** is a Docker-based tool that automates the processing of triage collections from Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. It uses Plaso (`log2timeline.py`) to generate supertimelines from forensic artifacts and exports them directly to Elasticsearch using `psort.py`.

For collecting triage data, it is recommended to use KAPE (Windows only) or CyLR (which also supports Linux and macOS). 
Both tools support SFTP output.

## üöÄ Features

- Monitors a local directory for new triage collections
- Automatically runs `log2timeline` to parse forensic data
- Pushes timelines to Elasticsearch via `psort.py` 
- Runs as a Docker container


---

## üîß How It Works

1. The container starts and listens for new collections added to `/path/to/local/triage/data`
2. When a new collection is detected, it:
   - Generates a `.plaso` file using `log2timeline.py`
   - Uploads the timeline to Elasticsearch using `psort.py`
   - Saves the `.plaso` file to `/path/to/local/triage/output`
